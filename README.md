# ProtoLogger

This is a small handmade logger written using .NET Core 3.1, it can log to a file or the console.

I took advantage of the default dependency injection provided by the .NET Core engine to get an easy setup of the logger. In Projects using a startup file like a worker service or an ASP Core application the setup is extremely easy
